YAML(short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data serialization format.
It's often used for configuration files, data exchange, and other applications where data
needs to be represented in a structured way.
YAML is designed to be easy to read and write, even by non-technical users,
and to work well with a variety of programming languages.

YAML SYNTAX
The basic structure of YAML is based on the use of indentation to indicate structure.
This means that each level of structure is indented by a fixed number of spaces (usually 2 or 4).
Here's an example of a YAML file that represents a simple shopping list:

- Milk     the hyphen symbol(-) is used to indicate a list item
- Bread
- Eggs

name: John Smith
age: 35
isMarried: true
favoriteFoods:
  - Pizza
  - Tacos
  - Sushi
birthdate: 1987-05-12

the colon symbol (:) is used to seperate the key (the name of the data item)
from the value (the data itself). The data types include a string (name), a number (age),
a boolean (isMarried), a list (favoriteFoods), and a date (birthdate)

# dictionary                {
person:                        "person": {
  # k/v: string                  "name": "John Smith",
  name: John Smith               "age": 35,
  # k/v: number                  "isMarried": true,
  age: 35                        "favoriteFoods":  [
  # k/v: boolean                   "Pizza",
  isMarried: true                  "Tacos",
                        ->         "Sushi"
  # nested dictionary            ],
  favoriteFoods:                 "birthdate": "1987-05-12"
    # list                     }
    - Pizza                  }
    - Tacos
    - Sushi
  # date birthday
  birthdate: 1987-05-12
