Structures
● Collection of data members under one name is structure
● Data members can be of similar type or non similar type
● When structures is called in the main() program then it will consume space
  accordingly to the data members types it contains in the memory

An example of structure is a program of a rectangle

Struct Rectangle
{
  int length;
  int breath;
}

int main()
{
  struct Rectangle r;            - Declaration
  struct Rectangle r = {10, 5};  - Declaration + Initialisation
  r.length = 15;                 - . Is is used to access a member
  r.breath = 10;

  printf(" Area of rectangle is %d", r.length * r.breath); - Accessing the members
}

Use of structures:
