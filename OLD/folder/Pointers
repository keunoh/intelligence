● Pointer is a address variable that is meant for storing address of not data itself
● They are used for indirect access of data
● For a program to use heap memory, pointers is used
● To access heap memory and resources outside the main memory like internet, keyboard, monitor etc pointers is used
● Pointers are also used for parameter passing

Example:
int main() 
{
  int a = 10;        - data variable
  int *p;            - declaration
  p = &a;            - Assginment / Initialisation
  printf("%d", a);  
  printf("%d", *p);   - dereferencing
}

● Accessing Heap memory through pointer

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int *p;
  p = new int[5];
    -> make a variable on heap momory and give an address to p
}

Why?
1. Accessing Heap Memory
2. Accessing Resources 
  -> like files, keyboard, monitor an so on.
3. Parameter Passing

● Every pointers have a same size
int *p1;
char *p2;
struct Rectangle *p3;
